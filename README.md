# AMAYARA-Lab

アマヤラ (Android Malware Analysis YARA) Lab is a project that provides a ready-to-use Jupyter Lab environment to help out with Android malware analysis using YARA rules.

## Usage

In order to launch the lab, open your favourite *Terminal* and run Jupyter Lab:

```sh
jupyter-lab
```

You can then access to the [amayara_lab.ipynb](https://github.com/tsumarios/AMAYARA-Lab/amayara_lab.ipynb) notebook and follow its instructions.

*N.B.* only a test rule and a JSON result from a local test were included in the files within this repository, since I did not intend to upload malware samples.
